### *Freedom Evolves* by Daniel Dennett


### Quotes

> Trading in a supernatural soul for a natural soul—is this a good
> bargain? What do we give up and what do we gain? -- location 194

> Now, for the first time in its billions of years of history, our
> planet is protected by far-seeing sentinels, able to anticipate danger
> from the distant future—a comet on a collision course, or global
> warming—and devise schemes for doing something about it. The planet
> has finally grown its own nervous system: us. -- location 218
> 
> Note: Ugh Edit Look around at those who are participating in this
> quest for further scientific knowledge and eagerly digesting the new
> discoveries; they are manifestly not short on optimism, moral
> conviction, engagement in life, commitment to society. In fact, if you
> want to find anxiety, despair, and anomie among intellectuals today
> look to the recently fashionable tribe of postmodernists, who like to
> claim that modern science is just another in a long line of myths, its
> institutions and expensive apparatus just the rituals and
> accoutrements of yet another religion. That intelligent people can
> take this seriously is a testimony to the power that fearful thinking
> still has, in spite of our advances in self-knowledge. -- location 233
> 
> Note: ugh. what a tired, self-satisfied, straw man Edit “Be all that
> you can be!”—a thrilling recruiting slogan for the U.S. Army, but does
> it conceal a mocking tautology? Aren’t we all, automatically, all that
> we can be? -- location 265

> If determinism is true, although there may well seem to be a point,
> this is an illusion. Indeed, we may well be determined to go on
> thinking that there is a point, but if so, we will be wrong. location
> 276

> The first attempt to soften the blow of atomism was by Epicurus and
> his followers, who proposed that a random swerve in the trajectories
> of some of those atoms might provide the elbow room for free choice,
> but since wishful thinking was their only grounds for postulating this
> random swerve, it was met from the outset with deserved
> skepticism. -- location 278

> The classical problem of free will, defined and endorsed by centuries
> of work by philosophers, theologians, and scientists, asks whether the
> world is so constituted as to permit us to make genuinely free,
> responsible decisions. The answer depends, it has always seemed, on
> basic, eternal facts—the fundamental laws of physics (whatever they
> turn out to be) and definitional truths about the nature of matter,
> time, and causation, and equally fundamental definitional truths about
> the nature of our minds, such as the fact that a stone or a sunflower
> couldn’t possibly have free will—only something with a mind is even a
> candidate for this blessing, whatever it is. I will try to show that
> this traditional problem of free will is, in spite of its pedigree, a
> distractor, a puzzle of no real importance that draws our attention
> away from some neighboring concerns that truly matter, that ought to
> keep us awake nights worrying. -- location 298

> The genuine threat, the submerged source of the anxiety that makes the
> free will topic such a perennial riveter of attention in philosophy
> courses, arises from a set of facts about the human situation that are
> empirical, and even, in one sense, political: They are sensitive to
> human attitude. It really makes a difference what we think about
> them. -- location 306

> Some of them insist that although free will is an illusion, this
> discovery has no significant bearing on how they think about their
> lives, their hopes and plans and fears, but they do not bother
> elaborating on this curious separation of issues. -- location 331

> Do we live in a universe in which striving and hoping, regretting,
> blaming, promising, trying to do better, condemning and praising make
> sense? -- location 346

> Free will is real, but it is not a preexisting feature of our
> existence, like the law of gravity. It is also not what tradition
> declares it to be: a God-like power to exempt oneself from the causal
> fabric of the physical world. It is an evolved creation of human
> activity and beliefs, and it is just as real as such other human
> creations as music and money. -- location 374

> If we can’t go along with the gag, aren’t we at least obliged to
> button our lips or change the topic of conversation? Certainly there

> Note: uhm, who thinks this? Edit My fundamental perspective is
> naturalism , the idea that philosophical investigations are not
